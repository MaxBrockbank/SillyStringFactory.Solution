#### Generate MySQL Database Using Entity Framework Core
1. In your terminal navigate to the SillyStringFactory.Solution/Factory directory. `cd Factory`.
2. Run the command `dotnet ef database update`. Entity Framework Core will then generate the database structure using the included migration files. 
3. __OPTIONALLY__, should you need to make changes to the code that adjust the structure of the databse, you can apply those updates with the following two commands.
